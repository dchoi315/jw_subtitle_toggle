This tool is mainly targeted to Korean Language learners.
Users should watch the drama with no subtitles initially to try to understand the situation. If the dialogue is not comprehensible, english subtitles can be toggled on to understand the drama scene.

How it works:

By clicking on the extension icon - custom keyboard shortcut can be created.
Upon refresh, the keyboard shortcut can be pressed to toggle subtitles

DEPRECATED
The packed chrome extension on the chrome store does not work. Only works for the unpacked version. A bug to fix for the next update.
